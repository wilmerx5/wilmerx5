🔭 I’m currently working as a Web Developer — building awesome digital experiences for real-world clients! I'm actively working with technologies like Next.js, WordPress, and AWS, delivering both frontend and backend solutions that make a difference.

🌱 Always learning: While gaining hands-on experience in production environments, I continue to expand my knowledge in modern JavaScript frameworks, cloud infrastructure, and full-stack development. Staying curious and up-to-date with industry trends is part of my daily routine.

🚀 Passionate about tech and problem-solving, I enjoy turning complex challenges into elegant, scalable, and user-friendly web solutions.
